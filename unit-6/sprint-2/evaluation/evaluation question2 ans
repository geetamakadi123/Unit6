ans:
JPA:
It is defined in javax.persistence package. 

JPA stand for Java Persistence  API .
It defines the management of relational data in java application.

It is a specification of various ORM  tools implement it for data persistences.

EntityManagerFactory interface is used to  interact with entity for the persistence unit which is link in persistemce file.

It uses the java persistence query language as object oriented query language to perform database operations.

It uses EntityManager interface to create ,update,delete operations and read also for mapped entity classes.

Hibernate:
It is defined in org.hibernate package. 

Hibernate is an implementation of JPA rules.and hibernate is an Object relational Mapping 
tool which is usedto save the state of java object into the database.

It uses the Hibernate Query Language as a object oriented query language to perform database.

It uses Session interface to create , read and delete operation for mapped entity classes.
**********************************************************************************************

What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?
ans:
1  hibernate itself takes care of mapping using XML files so developer does not need to write code for mapping;
JDBC supports only native SQL

2  mapping of Java objects with database tables has to be taken care of in JDBC. hibernate provides transparent persistence; 
and there is no need to map database tables
