Q7. Explain what a Primary key, Candidate Key, Prime Attributes,
and Non-prime Attributes is.


ans:
     
     A primary key is the column or columns that contain values that uniquely identify each row 
     in a table. A database table must have a primary key for Optim to insert, update, restore, 
     or delete data from a database table. Optim uses primary keys that are defined to the database.
     However, you can also define primary keys to supplement those in the database.
     
     A candidate key is a minimal super key or a super key with no redundant attribute. 
     It is called a minimal superkey because we select a candidate key from a set of super key such 
     that selected candidate key is the minimum attribute required to uniquely identify the table.
     
     A prime attribute is an attribute that is part of any candidate key. It can also be used to uniquely
     identify a tuple in the schema. A prime attribute in DBMS is also known as a key attribute. A non-prime 
     attribute is one that is not part of one of the candidate keys.
     
     An attribute that is not part of any candidate key is known as non-prime attribute. An attribute that is 
     a part of one of the candidate keys is known as prime attribute. Non-prime attributes: all attributes except
     emp_id are non-prime as they are not part of any candidate keys.
