Q3/- What is the difference between WebApplication and Web-services?

  ANS =>

        Web services is a part of WebApplication.

        In WebApplication we can generate a   html form like a web page response.
        but in Web service we can get the data in raw form like json,xml etc

        in Webapplication we can deploy our html page in webserver only like browse software etc
        but in Webservice we can use that raw data for browser software or anytype of application
        in any technology.

        Web application response is not reusable because we deploy in it web server
        whereas Web service data is reusable any other application or web application
        use that data and present it's in their own browser.
