Q4. Explain about the basic properties of pom.xml file.

ANS=>
      Maven properties are value placeholders, like properties in Ant.
      Their values are accessible anywhere within a POM by using the notation
      ${X}, where X is the property. Or they can be used by plugins as default
      values, for example: In your case you have defined properties as version of java.
