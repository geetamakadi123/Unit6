Q1-> Explain Layared Architecture in Business application;


Answar:
Layered architectures are said to be the most common and widely used architectural framework in software development. It is also known as an n-tier architecture and describes an architectural pattern composed of several separate horizontal layers that function together as a single unit of software. A layer is a logical separation of components or code:


Components of a Layered Architecture
Now, the number of layers in a layered architecture is not set to a specific number and is usually dependent on the developer or software architect. It is important to note that this framework will usually always have a user interaction layer, a layer for processing, and a layer that deals with data processing. These are described further as:


Presentation Layer – responsible for user interactions with the software system
Application/Business Layer – handles aspects related to accomplishing functional requirements
Domain Layer – responsible for algorithms, and programming components
Infrastructure/Persistence/Database Layer – responsible for handling data, databases

Advantages and Disadvantages
The following are the benefits and drawbacks that exist with this software pattern:

Advantages

The framework is simple and easy to learn and implement.
There is reduced dependency because the function of each layer is separate from the other layers.
Testing is easier because of the separated components, each component can be tested individually.
Cost overheads are fairly low.
Disadvantages

Scalability is difficult because the structure of the framework does not allow for growth.
They can be difficult to maintain. A change in a single layer can affect the entire system because it operates as a single unit.
There is interdependence between layers since a layer depends on the layer above it to receive data.
Parallel processing is not possible.
