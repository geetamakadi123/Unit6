Q1/- What do you mean by the IOC, explain the life cycle of the Spring
Bean.


Ans
In general, when a class depends on another class then the dependent class creates the object of its
dependency class directly, and then uses(call) its methods, it is called the dependency object created in the
main control.
But if some external entity is taking care of creating the dependency object then we say that control is inverted
to some external entity, this is called Inversion of Control (IOC).
The IOC is a design principle that is purely conceptual, in which an external entity provides the dependencies to the
application components instead of hard coding them in the component class.


Dependency Injection:
Here external entity will push the dependency object to the dependent class (configuring the object inside some
container. and the container will push the dependency object to the dependent class).
Note: In the spring framework, The spring container is the external entity that will push the dependency object to
the dependent class.





life cycle of the Spring  Bean:
          
Bean life cycle is managed by the spring container    When we run the program 
 spring container gets started. after that, the container creates the
 instance of a bean as per the request, and then dependencies are injected. and finally  bean is destroyed 
 when the spring container is closed.
