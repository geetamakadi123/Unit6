Q8. What are the rules for a table to be in 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF?

ans:
     First Normal Form (1NF)
     Every column in the table must be unique.
     Separate tables must be created for each set of related data.
     Each table must be identified with a unique column or concatenated columns called the primary key.
     No rows may be duplicated.
     no columns may be duplicated.
     
     Second Normal Form (2NF):
     Second Normal Form (2NF) is based on the concept of full functional dependency. Second Normal Form 
     applies to relations with composite keys, that is, relations with a primary key composed of two or more
     attributes. A relation with a single-attribute primary key is automatically in at least 2NF. A relation 
     that is not in 2NF may suffer from the update anomalies.

     To be in second normal form, a relation must be in first normal form and relation must not contain any 
     partial dependency. A relation is in 2NF if it has No Partial Dependency, i.e., no non-prime attribute
    (attributes which are not part of any candidate key) is dependent on any proper subset of any candidate 
     key of the table.
     
     Third Normal Form (3NF):

     A relation is in third normal form, if there is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes as well 
     as it is in second normal form. A relation is in 3NF if at least one of the following condition holds in 
     every non-trivial function dependency X â€“> Y: X is a super key.
