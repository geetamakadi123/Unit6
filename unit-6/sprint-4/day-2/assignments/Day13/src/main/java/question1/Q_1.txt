Q1/- What is a Servlet ? What is the role of the DispatcherServlet in the Spring boot restapplication.

ANS =>
   Servlet is one type of Controller that controls the flow of web server.

   Whenever any request came from web application or web services
   servlet takes that request and authenticate or validate the request and
   pass it to service layer  class.

   after that service layer perform the business logic through data access layer
   and return the output to servlet class.

   servlet class return the response to web application or web server.

  So in basic servlet is a class which controls the flow of web server.

  But in Spring MVC there is one inbuild Servlet class there whose name 
  is DispatcherServlet.We just need to configure that class to control the flow
  but in normal class we have to write everything in servlet class.


  but with the Spring Boot, DispatcherServlet is already configured as a front controller of our application.
  further more Spring boot also provides integrated tomcat server to deploy our application.
