Q2/-  Explain the difference between Spring-MVC and Spring Boot.

ANS =>
      Spring Boot is a one module of Spring framework to build 
      Web-server efficiently.
 
      Spring MVC is model view controller web framework under spring framework.

      Spring boot provides default configuration to all spring based framework.
      whereas Spring MVC provides ready to use feature to build web application

      Spring boot we didn't need to configure manualy but in Spring MVC 
      we have to configure mmanualy.

      In spring boot we didn't need any deployment descripter it inbuilts provide
      that like tomcat but in spring mvc we need a descripter

      here In spring boot  no boiler plate code and we reduce the code to 
      write dependencies in single unit but in MVC we have to write
      dependencies in different to unit.

     spring boot reduces deployement time and increase efficiency of developer.
     but spring mvc takes more time to do same.
