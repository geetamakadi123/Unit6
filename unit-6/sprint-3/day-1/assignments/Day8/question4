Q4/- Write Short notes on how the Spring framework evolves.

Spring framework is an open source Java platform. It was initially written by Rod Johnson and was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003.

Spring is lightweight when it comes to size and transparency. The basic version of Spring framework is around 2MB.
